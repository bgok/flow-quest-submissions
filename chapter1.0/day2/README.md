# The Flow Blockchain & Cadence
## Chapter 1, Day 2

### What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
1. Safety and Security

Since smart contracts are usually used to track things that have value, safety and security are extremely important. It ensures that assets can't be stolen or manipulated in ways that weren't intended.

2. Clarity

When a transaction is signed, it is important to understand what the outcome of the transaction will be. Using a programming language that is easy to read makes the code approachable to people who aren't programmers. Most people can read a smart contract written in Cadence and get the gist of what it does. A clear, concise programming language also decreases mistake by the programmers who use it and makes it easier for other programmers to understand it in the future or to review it to make sure it is correct. 

3. Approachability

The Cadence language is similar in structure and syntax to many popular programming languages like C, Java and Javascript. This makes it easier for a programmer experienced with these languages to learn.   

4. Developer Experience

Programming ecosystems need to make it easy for programmers to write, test, debug, and deploy code. When a programmer has to search a Discord server to find error codes, it slows them down and makes for a frustrating experience (*a'hem* Stacks Clarity *cough cough*). The less time that a programmer spends fussing with the details, the more time they can spend refining the experience for users. 

5. Resource Oriented Programming

I'm a little Rusty on this topic.

### In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
