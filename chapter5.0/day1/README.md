### Quests

#### 1. Describe what an event is, and why it might be useful to a client.
Events are a way for a smart contract to communicate that something happened. They can be used by off-chain processes for reporting or to update status of a DAPP.

#### 2. Deploy a contract with an event in it, and emit the event somewhere else in the contract indicating that it happened.
